<p>Guinea pigs are large for rodents; the common pet breeds weigh between 700 and 1,200 g when full grown and measure between 20 and 25 cm in length. Some livestock breeds weigh 3 kilograms when full grown.Pet breeds live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight. According to the 2006 Guinness World Records, the longest living guinea pig survived 14 years, 10.5 months.Most guinea pigs have fur, but one laboratory breed adopted by some pet owners, the skinny pig, is a mostly furless breed. Some breeds are longfur breeds such as the Peruvian, the Silkie, and the Texel.
